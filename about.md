Hello there, my name is Florian Mainguy or <a href="https://twitter.com/WouFonTheRooF">@WouFonTheRoof</a>. I started this blog when I decided to learn software development on my own. Over the years I tried to keep it updated with my career milestones.

I am now an Information Security Analyst focusing mainly on Cyber Security.
