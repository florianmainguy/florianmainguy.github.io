I'm Florian Mainguy, a french expat living in England (Lichfield, Staffs) who despite his affection for food doesn't eat frog legs. 

Through this blog I would like to share things I like, my thoughts and my projects. It could be about Physics, Electronics, Programming or even Art, Music and History.

My passion is to learn, whatever the subject.

Enjoy

Florian

EDIT: Following the birth of my son, I stopped updating this blog.
