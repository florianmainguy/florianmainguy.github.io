I'm Florian Mainguy, a french living in England who despite his affection for food doesn't eat frog legs. 

Through this blog I would like to share what I like, my thoughts and my projects. It could be about Physics, Electronics, Programming or even Art, Music and History.

My passion is to learn. Whatever the subject.

To drop me an email: florian.mainguy@gmail.com

Enjoy

Florian
