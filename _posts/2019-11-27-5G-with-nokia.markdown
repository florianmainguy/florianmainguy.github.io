For the last couple of years, I have been working on 5G with Nokia as a R&D software developer. I specifically worked on a project called Airphone, which is a simulator of multi 5G devices and is used to test internally the 5G solution developed by Nokia. This was for sure quite an adventure!

I knew nothing about the telecommunication industry, and I never worked on projects that big before. Unfortunately, I can't share anything about it publicly, but I'll try to summarise what I've learned:

- I contributed to a large team project (250 people worlwide)
- We used the Agile methodology and scrums/squads
- Programming was mainly in C++ and Python
- All code needed to be covered by tests. We used Unit Tests for function testing, Module Tests for bigger scope testing, and System Component Testing for the larger scope. One of the test frameworks was Pytest
- Version control was done with Git
- Code reviews were done with Gerrit
- Integration was continuous (CI/CD) and performed with Jenkins/Zuul
- I was really interested by the big picture, so I often analysed dark areas of the soft and introduced it to other team members

This may seem nothing special, but a big project experience was exactly what I was looking for. My work was appreciated and I even had the opportunity to become Architect. I really enjoyed working in an international environment. 5G is not here yet but I'm already proud I have been part of it!
