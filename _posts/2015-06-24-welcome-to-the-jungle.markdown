Hello to you. Welcome to the party.

So, maybe I should explain why I'm doing this blog ?

I love to learn. Learn what ? It doesn't really matter, as long as I learn something. It could be about Physics, Electronics, Programming or even Art, Music or History. And writing about what I learn makes me investigate more and understand the subject deeper.
I used to create kind of revision notes, it's a great exercise to make you focus on the essentials due to the fact you need to synthesize on one page.

Now, I would like to share my researches through this blog. It will enhance my programming skills as well as my writing skills. 
Being french and writing in english is also a challenge. But I'm brave enough to take it.

So here I am, in front of a new world, and it's quite exciting.
