Hello to you. Welcome to the party.

So, maybe I should explain why I'm doing this blog ?

I love to learn. Learn what ? It doesn't really matter, as long as I learn something. It could be about Physics, Electronics, Programming or even Art, Music or History. And writing about what I learn makes me investigate more and understand deeper the subject.
I used to create kind of revision notes, that are a great exercise to make you focus on the essential due to the fact you need to synthesize on one page.

Now, I would like to share my researches through this blog. It will enhance my programming skills as well as my writing skills. The possibility to justify something or to add further ideas by linking another website is also a big pro of a blog compare to a revision note.
Being french and writing a blog in english is also a challenge. But I'm brave enough to take it.

So here I am, in front of a new world, and it's quiet exciting.
