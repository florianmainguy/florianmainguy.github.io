Hello to you. Welcome to the party.

So, maybe I should explain why I'm doing this blog ?

Basically, because It's fun.

I love to learn. Learn what ? It doesn't really matter, as long as I learn something. Of course, I have some favorite learning fields. I often read about Physics, Acoustics, Signal Processing or Electronics. I like to know how things work and I'm not afraid to look again at basics to really understand beyond the wall. From the beginning of this year I went through Fourier Transform, how PN Junction are physically made at atom level, the Uncertainty Principle or even WHAT THE HELL WAS GROUCHY DOING EATING STRAWBERRIES WHILE NAPOLEON WAS FIGHTING WELLINGTON AT WATERLOO !!! 
Yes, I like History too.

With that last remark you might have guessed where I'm from. If I tell you that I love baguettes, you don't need anymore clues.
French and living in the UK with my lovely wife, I'm enjoying my time here while improving my english (I like learning you remember ?). 

This blog is definitely a good way to improve my language skills, but also my programming skills. There we are !

I have always been interested by the programming world, but never brave enough to jump into it. I learned a bit of C, a bit of html/css, mainly at school, and that's it. But I didn't love it. You know why ? Because I had no personal project. I learned a tool that I didn't need. Teach me how to fix a boat, I won't be interested. Offer me a boat (all in wood please), and teach me again, I would spend all my spare time on it. That how it works for me. And that's how I fell into programming again, but this time it was my choice. 
The project that made me start this adventure is a story about an old valve radio and embedded systems, but let's stop here for now, I would like to keep some content for this blog later..

So here I am, in front of a new world, and it's quiet exciting.
I have just started <a href="http://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, which goal is to teach all the basics needed to be a junior web developer, and it's been really nice so far. So if you enjoyed this introduction, please feel free to come back sometimes, have a look at my projects, send me an email about anything or buy me a boat.

Enjoy
