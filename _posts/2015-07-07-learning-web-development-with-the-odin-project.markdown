Do you feel the viking spirits calling you ?

Do you want to kiss the seven seas along on your drakkar ?

If so, join me on The Odin Project.

A few months ago, I decided to learn programming. I was fixing an old valve radio, and I thought I could add an embedded system in it to catch internet stations. I did some reasearch, and I believed I could write the program myself instead of copying an existing one on internet. This was certainly a big step. 

This project made me enter the programming world. Ans as I like traveling, I wanted to see other areas.
Interested by web development, I had a look a some websites that teach web languages. My choice was for The Odin Project.

The Odin Project is an open source website dedicated to providing free online training, to anyone interesting by web development. 

The curriculum is the following:

<ol>
    <li>Introduction to web development</li>
    <li>Web development 101</li>
    <li>Ruby programming</li>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>HTML5 and CSS3</li>
    <li>Javascript and jQuery</li>
    <li>Getting hired as a web developer</li>
</ol>

What I like in the Odin Project, is that it actually send you to the best websites to learn what you need to learn. It's a kind of guided directory with some project breaks.

For instance, in the "Web development 101" chapter, that is simply a chapter where you learn the basics of all the languages you will learn later, there is a part on Javascript. And here is the assignment:

<ol>
    <li>Do Codecademy's Javascript sections 1-5, to get the basics</li>
    <li>Play with some in-browser IDE like jsfiddle.net or Codecademy Labs to have to real sense of what Javascript can do</li>
    <li>Use it to solve logical problems from Project Euler</li>
</ol>

And that's all. You will learn deeper Javascript in another chapter.

That really worked with me. Before taking the course, I didn't know what programming teaching website choose. And the Odin Project showed me where to go.

Right now, I'm still in the "web development 101 chapter". I finished the front-end section and I'm gonna start the Ruby part. I don't know how long will take this project, but I still feel very excited and motivated, so let's keep it up !
