It's been 2 months now that I started learning programming through The Odin Project. And I finally finished the first part, Web Development 101.

![TOP Web 101]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/TOP_web_101.png)

Working full time, I spent between 10 and 15 hours per week on TOP. I have also somme other small projects (this blog for instance) and a BIG one with my girlfriend (we expect a baby). Though, I can't fit much more time in!

But it's allright.

Even if I don't spend all week writing different languages, I try to practise a little bit on a daily basis. For that, <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is great. When I have free time but not enough to focus on learning new concepts, I tend to pick the next problem on my Project Euler account and I (try to) solve it. I even do it during my lunch break at work sometimes. And when I'm done, I go back to TOP.

So now, I have a barely understanding of what is web development. I can use different languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby), make some easy projects using version control Git and host them on my Github account. I use Vim, Sublime Text or Brackets as a text editor and Heroku to deploy an app (Ok ok... I've only used it once but it's only the beginning!).

And that's why I loved this first chapter.

I'm not ready to work as a developer or to do freelance work. But I understand what it involves and it gives me even more motivation to pursue this adventure. I'm starting now the following chapter, whose focus in on Ruby.

Let's go deeper.

And to finish, here is a list of the small projects I realized through this first chapter:
