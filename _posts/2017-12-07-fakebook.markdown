Getting back into Rails, with a challenging project I finally completed. Basically a Facebook clone, with Devise for the authentication and CarrierWave to upload pictures. 

This is also the final project of the Rails curriculum in The Odin Project. 

My dreams to be friend with Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Vandamne finally come true.
