Here is a simple memo to remind me some basic commands. I will update this list from time to time.

{% highlight ruby %}
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/someone/repo.git

# Init
git init

# Add all files changed
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Comment"

# Pushes commits from local branch(master) to remote(origin)
git push origin master

# Change remote's URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/someone/repo.git

# Pull changes from remote repository
git pull origin master
{% endhighlight %}
