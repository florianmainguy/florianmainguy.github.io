# Wonderful Blog

Personal blog I used to post random thoughts. It was a good excercise to improve my writing skills. I didn't use Wordpress neither, so good excercise for HTML/CSS too.
Following the birth of my son I stopped updating it. I leave it online due to the amazing quality of the posts <cough>.
